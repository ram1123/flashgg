Validation plots
================

- Draw simple comparison plots between GLOBE flattrees and FLASHgg globe-like ntuples. 

- Plots options can be tuned through a python config file (see cfg/MakeValidationPlot.py as example).

- produce comparison plots with: 
``` MakeValidationPlots Validation/cfg/MakeValidationPlot.py ```

- note that by default plots are store in flashgg/Validation/plots/
